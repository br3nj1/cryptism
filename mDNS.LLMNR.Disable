Blocking mDNS in Browser Extensions
Some browsers might use mDNS even if the WebRTC setting is disabled. For a stricter approach:

Use a browser extension like uBlock Origin or NoScript to block multicast DNS requests.
Configure rules to prevent access to 224.0.0.251:5353 (the mDNS multicast address and port).

==============================================

# Restrict Browsers

Open Browser, Go To following URL:
edge://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns
chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns
vivaldi://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns

Look for the WebRTC: Hide Local IPs with mDNS flag.
Set it to Disabled.

firefox |  about:config > network.mdns.enabled

mDNS Description

What is mDNS?
Multicast DNS (mDNS) is a network protocol that resolves hostnames to IP addresses within local networks without requiring a traditional DNS server. It is commonly used for device discovery and communication on small, local networks (e.g., home or office environments).

Key Features
Protocol: Part of the Zeroconf/Bonjour suite, mDNS uses the UDP protocol over port 5353.
Local Discovery: Enables devices like printers, smart TVs, or IoT devices to advertise and discover services without manual configuration.
Multicast: Sends DNS-like queries to all devices in the local subnet via the multicast IP address 224.0.0.251.

Use Cases
Service Discovery: Devices can announce and discover services such as printing or file sharing (e.g., AirPrint, AirPlay).
IoT Integration: Essential for smart home devices to locate and communicate with each other.
Local Hostname Resolution: Resolves local device names (e.g., myprinter.local) without a central DNS server.

Security Concerns
Potential for Abuse: Attackers can exploit mDNS to perform reconnaissance or amplify DDoS attacks.
Uncontrolled Traffic: mDNS broadcasts can create unnecessary network congestion.

For environments where mDNS isn't needed, it's recommended to disable it for better performance and security.
